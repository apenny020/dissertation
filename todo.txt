for data_processor.py:
- Workout how many patients go on each pathway?
- Maybe add total time from check in to check out?
- collecting_days_data --> needs commenting
- calculating_times --> can be made more efficient - not crucial
                    - for future and previous action, need to make sure its still the same patient reference
                    - need to add a loop so that it calls give_date until dates run out
                    - make dict creation more efficient
- calculating_patient_numbers -->
                    - needs finishing in the elifs
- give_date -->
                    - needs to be changed so that its give which day refeerncing (either an actual day or a counter)
                    - add returns
                    - take calling the functions out? or rename the function to better reflect itself
- write the running code
- need to add in looking for number of Cancelled
- if the patient does not have complete as final action it needs to be disregarded
- if any waiting time is longer than 8hours it needs to be ignored
- if consultant waiting time is longer than 2hours it neesds to be ignored
- further work -->
                    - Different days could have different waiting times based on number of nurses etc --> update to reflect the correlation
                    - Work out number of staff


for data_analyser.py:
- add the plotting
- need to add something for getting the likelihood?

for agents.py #PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!
- Patient_agent, __init__ -->
                        - update the attributes and therefore the ()
                -->
                - do the create()
- Integrate with omni

-add an environment and how they can intereact with it?

#finish going through main
#stop the cyclical part of data analyser
#add in data
#check the leave on each run (for patient satisfaction on patient)
#add 'environment' (space in room and time) to agents file?
#make sure that the patient doesnt arrive before the clinic opens
#do patient satisfaction update function
#put check for next patient in the agents functions?
#make sure youre randomly generating the number of consultants (bonus, based on data captured)
#add check for sick consultant when initialising
#add something that prevents people from entering if waiting room full, or decreases satisfaction faster
