for data_processor.py:
- Workout how many patients go on each pathway?
- Maybe add total time from check in to check out?
- collecting_days_data --> needs commenting
- calculating_times --> can be made more efficient - not crucial
                    - for future and previous action, need to make sure its still the same patient reference
                    - need to add a loop so that it calls give_date until dates run out
                    - make dict creation more efficient
- calculating_patient_numbers -->
                    - needs finishing in the elifs
- give_date -->
                    - needs to be changed so that its give which day refeerncing (either an actual day or a counter)
                    - add returns
                    - take calling the functions out? or rename the function to better reflect itself
- write the running code
- need to add in looking for number of Cancelled
- if the patient does not have complete as final action it needs to be disregarded
- if any waiting time is longer than 8hours it needs to be ignored
- if consultant waiting time is longer than 2hours it neesds to be ignored
- further work -->
                    - Different days could have different waiting times based on number of nurses etc --> update to reflect the correlation
                    - Work out number of staff


for data_analyser.py:
add this comment: 
    #but need to check between each section - collect the data and use numpy - workout how long the like quickest 10% were on average
    #then 20%, 30% etc, find the longest and if reaches this time then called basically.
    #for distribution - record all times and then order them, then you can take length divided by x to get a certain proportion of the distribution
